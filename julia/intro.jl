A Tutorial Introduction
***********************

We will begin by a quick tutorial on Knet, going over the essential
tools for defining, training, and evaluating real machine learning
models.  The goal is to get you to the point where you can create your
own models and apply machine learning to your own problems as quickly
as possible.  So some of the details and exceptions will be skipped
for now.  No prior knowledge of machine learning or Julia is
necessary, but general programming experience will be assumed.  It
would be best if you follow along with the examples on your computer.

Functions and models
--------------------
.. @knet, compile, forw, get

In this section, we will create our first Knet model, and learn how to
make predictions.  To start using Knet, type ``using Knet`` at the
Julia prompt::

   julia> using Knet

.. testsetup::

   using Knet
   setseed(42);

In Knet, a machine learning model is defined using a special function
syntax with the ``@knet`` macro.  The following example defines a
@knet function for a simple linear regression model with 13 inputs and
a single output. You can type this definition at the Julia prompt, or
you can copy and paste it into a file which can be loaded into Julia
using ``include("filename")``:

.. testcode::

    @knet function lin(x)
        w = par(init=Gaussian(0,0.1), dims=(1,13))
        b = par(init=Constant(0), dims=(1,1))
        return w * x .+ b
    end

.. testoutput:: :hide:

   ...

.. _Julia function: http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.4/manual/functions
.. _variable: http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.4/manual/variables
.. _Broadcasting operations: http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.4/manual/arrays/#broadcasting

In this definition:

- ``@knet`` indicates that ``lin`` is a special Knet function, it does
  not get defined as a regular `Julia function`_ or variable_.
- ``x`` is the only input argument.
- ``w`` and ``b`` are model parameters as indicated by the ``par``
  constructor.
- ``init`` and ``dims`` are `keyword arguments`_ to ``par`` describing
  how the parameter should be initialized.  ``init`` can take a Julia
  array or one of the supported :ref:`random distributions
  <rgen-table>`.
- The final ``return`` statement specifies the output of the Knet
  function.
- The ``*`` denotes matrix product and ``.+`` denotes elementwise
  broadcasting addition.  `Broadcasting operations`_ can act on arrays
  with different sizes, such as adding a vector to each column of a
  matrix.  They expand singleton dimensions in array arguments to
  match the corresponding dimension in the other array without using
  extra memory, and apply the operation elementwise.
- Only a :ref:`restricted set of operators <primitives-table>` such as
  ``*`` and ``.+``, and statement types such as assignment and return
  statements can be used in a @knet function definition.

In order to turn ``lin`` into a machine learning model that can be
trained with examples and used for predictions, we need to compile it:

.. doctest::

    julia> f = compile(:lin)	# The colon before lin is required
    ...

To test our model let's give it some input.  ``w`` is a :math:`1\times
13` row vector, so the input ``x`` should be a :math:`13\times 1`
column vector.  Let's initialize with some random numbers:

.. doctest::

    julia> x = randn(13,1)
    13x1 Array{Float64,2}:...

To obtain the prediction of model ``f`` on input ``x`` we use the
``forw`` function, which basically calculates ``w * x .+ b``:

.. doctest::     
    
    julia> forw(f,x)
    1x1 Array{Float64,2}:
     -1.00532

We can query the model and see its parameters using ``get``:
      
.. doctest::

    julia> get(f,:w)		# The colon before w is required
    1x13 Array{Float64,2}:
     -0.556027  -0.444383  0.0271553 ... 1.08238  0.187028  0.518149

    julia> get(f,:b)
    1x1 Array{Float64,2}:
     1.49138
    
We can also look at the input with ``get(f,:x)``, reexamine the output
using the special ``:return`` symbol with ``get(f,:return)``.  In fact
using ``get``, we can confirm that our model gives us the same answer
as an equivalent Julia expression:

.. doctest::     

    julia> get(f,:w) * get(f,:x) .+ get(f,:b)
    1x1 Array{Float64,2}:
     -1.00532

In this section, we have seen how to create a Knet model by compiling
a @knet function, how to perform a prediction given an input using
``forw``, and how to take a look at model parameters using ``get``.
Next we will see how to train models.

Training a model
----------------
.. quadloss, back, update!, setp, lr

OK, so we can define functions using Knet but why should we bother?
The thing that makes a Knet model different from an ordinary function
is that Knet models are **differentiable programs**.  This means that
for a given input not only can they compute an output, but they can
also compute which way their parameters should be modified to approach
some desired output.  If we have some input-output data that comes
from an unknown function, we can train a Knet model to look like this
unknown function by manipulating its parameters.

.. _Housing: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing
.. _UCI Machine Learning Repository: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html

We will use the Housing_ dataset from the `UCI Machine Learning
Repository`_ to train our ``lin`` model.  The dataset has housing
related information for 506 neighborhoods in Boston from 1978.  Each
neighborhood has 14 attributes, the goal is to use the first 13, such
as average number of rooms per house, or distance to employment
centers, to predict the 14'th attribute: median dollar value of the
houses.  Here are the first 3 entries::

    0.00632  18.00   2.310  0  0.5380  6.5750  65.20  4.0900   1  296.0  15.30 396.90   4.98  24.00
    0.02731   0.00   7.070  0  0.4690  6.4210  78.90  4.9671   2  242.0  17.80 396.90   9.14  21.60
    0.02729   0.00   7.070  0  0.4690  7.1850  61.10  4.9671   2  242.0  17.80 392.83   4.03  34.70
    ...

.. _Requests: https://github.com/JuliaWeb/Requests.jl
.. _readdlm: http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.4/stdlib/io-network/#Base.readdlm

Let's download the dataset using Requests_, a Julia module that
enables downloading files from the internet using the :func:`get`
function and :func:`readdlm <readdlm>`, a function which turns space
or tab delimited data into a Julia array.  If for some reason this
does not work, you can download the data file from the given URL by
other means and run ``readdlm("housing.data")`` on the local file
instead::

   julia> using Requests
   julia> url = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/housing.data";
   julia> data = readdlm(get(url).data)'  # Don't forget the final apostrophe to transpose data
   14x506 Array{Float64,2}:...

.. doctest:: :hide:
   
   julia> data = readdlm(Pkg.dir("Knet/data/housing.data"))';
   
The resulting ``data`` matrix should have 506 columns representing
neighborhoods, and 14 rows representing the attributes.  The last
attribute is the median house price to be predicted, so let's separate
it:

.. doctest::
   
   julia> x = data[1:13,:]
   13x506 Array{Float64,2}:...
   julia> y = data[14,:]
   1x506 Array{Float64,2}:...

.. _Julia's array indexing: http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.4/manual/arrays/#indexing

Here we are using `Julia's array indexing`_ notation to split the
``data`` array into input ``x`` and output ``y``.  Inside the square
brackets ``1:13`` means grab the rows 1 through 13, and the ``:``
character by itself means grab all the columns.

You may have noticed that the input attributes have very different
ranges.  It is usually a good idea to normalize them by subtracting
the mean and dividing by the standard deviation:

.. doctest::

   julia> x = (x .- mean(x,2)) ./ std(x,2);

The :func:`mean` and :func:`std` functions compute the mean and
standard deviation of ``x``.  Their optional second argument gives the
dimensions to sum over, so ``mean(x)`` gives us the mean of the whole
array, ``mean(x,1)`` gives the mean of each column, and ``mean(x,2)``
gives us the mean of each row.

It is also a good idea to split our dataset into training and test
subsets so we can estimate how well our model will do on unseen data.

.. doctest::

   julia> n = size(x,2);
   julia> r = randperm(n);
   julia> xtrn=x[:,r[1:400]];
   julia> ytrn=y[:,r[1:400]];
   julia> xtst=x[:,r[401:end]];
   julia> ytst=y[:,r[401:end]];
    
``n`` is set to the number of instances (columns) and ``r`` is set to
:func:`randperm(n) <randperm>` which gives a random permutation of
integers :math:`1\ldots n`.  The first 400 indices in ``r`` will be
used for training, and the last 106 for testing.

Let's see how well our randomly initialized model does before
training:

.. doctest::

   julia> ypred = forw(f, xtst)
   1x106 Array{Float64,2}:...
   julia> quadloss(ypred, ytst)
   289.7437322259235

.. _RMSD: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation

The quadratic :ref:`loss function <loss-table>` :func:`quadloss`
computes :math:`(1/2n) \sum (\hat{y} - y)^2`, i.e. half of the mean
squared difference between a predicted answer :math:`\hat{y}` and the
desired answer :math:`y`.  Given that :math:`y` values range from 5 to
50, an RMSD_ of :math:`\sqrt{2\times 289.7}=24.07` is a pretty bad
score.

We would like to minimize this loss which should get the predicted
answers closer to the desired answers.  To do this we first compute
the loss gradient for the parameters of ``f`` -- this is the direction
in parameter space that maximally increases the loss.  Then we move
the parameters in the opposite direction.  Here is a simple function
that performs these steps:

.. testcode::
   
    function train(f, x, y)
        for i=1:size(x,2)
            forw(f, x[:,i])
            back(f, y[:,i], quadloss)
            update!(f)
        end
    end

.. testoutput::
   :hide:
      
   ...


* The ``for`` loop grabs training instances one by one.
* ``forw`` computes the prediction for the i'th instance.  This is required for the next step.
* ``back`` computes the loss gradient ``dw`` for each parameter ``w`` for the i'th instance.
* ``update!`` subtracts (a function of) ``dw`` from each ``w`` to reduce the loss.


Before training, it is important to set a good learning rate.  The
learning rate controls how large the update steps are going to be: too
small and you'd wait for a long time, too large and ``train`` may
never converge.  The :func:`setp` function is used to set
:ref:`training options <options-table>` like the learning rate.  Let's
set the learning rate to 0.001 and train the model for 100 epochs
(i.e. 100 passes over the dataset):

.. doctest::

   julia> setp(f, lr=0.001)
   julia> for i=1:100; train(f, xtrn, ytrn); end

This should take a few seconds, and this time our RMSD should be much
better:

.. doctest::
   
   julia> ypred = forw(f, xtst)
   1x106 Array{Float64,2}:...
   julia> quadloss(ypred,ytst)
   12.3349...
   julia> sqrt(2*ans)
   4.9668...

We can see what the model has learnt looking at the new weights:

.. doctest::

   julia> get(f,:w)
   1x13 Array{Float64,2}:
    -0.426154  0.765073  0.287288 ... -1.94362  0.837376  -3.45769

..
   julia> println(sortperm(vec(get(f,:w))))
   [13,8,11,5,10,1,7,3,2,4,12,9,6]

.. _UCI: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing

The two weights with the most negative contributions are 13 and 8.  We
can find out from UCI_ that these are::

  13. LSTAT: % lower status of the population
   8. DIS: weighted distances to five Boston employment centres

And the two with the most positive contributions are 9 and 6::

   9. RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways 
   6. RM: average number of rooms per dwelling
      
In this section we saw how to download data, turn it into a Julia
array, normalize and split it into input, output, train, and test
subsets.  We wrote a simple training script using ``forw``, ``back``,
and ``update!``, set the learning rate ``lr`` using ``setp``, and
evaluated the model using the ``quadloss`` loss function.  Now, there
are a lot more efficient and elegant ways to perform and analyze a
linear regression as you can find out from any decent statistics text.
However the basic method outlined in this section has the advantage of
being easy to generalize to models that are a lot more complicated as
we will see next.

Defining new operators
----------------------
..
   @knet as op, kwargs for @knet functions,
   function options (f=:relu).  splat.
   lenet example, fast enough on cpu?

The key to controlling complexity in computer languages is
**abstraction**.  Abstraction is the ability to name compound structures
built from primitive parts, so they too can be used as primitives.  In
Knet we do this by using @knet functions not as models, but as new
operators inside other @knet functions.

To illustrate this, we will use the LeNet_ convolutional neural
network model designed to recognize handwritten digits.  Here is the
LeNet model defined using only the :ref:`primitive operators of Knet
<primitives-table>`:

.. testcode::

    @knet function lenet1(x)    # dims=(28,28,1,N)
        w1 = par(init=Xavier(),   dims=(5,5,1,20))
        c1 = conv(w1,x)         # dims=(24,24,20,N)
        b1 = par(init=Constant(0),dims=(1,1,20,1))
        a1 = add(b1,c1)
        r1 = relu(a1)
        p1 = pool(r1; window=2) # dims=(12,12,20,N)

        w2 = par(init=Xavier(),   dims=(5,5,20,50))
        c2 = conv(w2,p1)        # dims=(8,8,50,N)
        b2 = par(init=Constant(0),dims=(1,1,50,1))
        a2 = add(b2,c2)
        r2 = relu(a2)
        p2 = pool(r2; window=2) # dims=(4,4,50,N)

        w3 = par(init=Xavier(),   dims=(500,800))
        d3 = dot(w3,p2)         # dims=(500,N)
        b3 = par(init=Constant(0),dims=(500,1))
        a3 = add(b3,d3)
        r3 = relu(a3)

        w4 = par(init=Xavier(),   dims=(10,500))
        d4 = dot(w4,r3)         # dims=(10,N)
        b4 = par(init=Constant(0),dims=(10,1))
        a4 = add(b4,d4)
        return soft(a4)         # dims=(10,N)
    end

.. testoutput:: :hide:

.. _GoogLeNet: http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842

.. .. _Caffe: http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/gathered/examples/mnist.html

.. .. [#] This definition closely follows the Caffe_ implementation.

.. In our first model ``lin``, we had specified model parameters by
.. passing random arrays to the ``init`` argument.  LeNet uses a
.. different alternative, the parameters are specified by indicating
.. their size with the ``dims`` argument and random distributions
.. (``Xavier()`` and ``Constant(0)``) with the ``init`` argument.

Don't worry about the details of the model if you don't know much
about neural nets.  At 22 lines long, this model looks a lot more
complicated than our linear regression model.  Compared to state of
the art image processing models however, it is still tiny.  You
would not want to code a state-of-the-art model like GoogLeNet_ using
these primitives.

If you are familiar with neural nets, and peruse the :ref:`Knet
primitives table <primitives-table>`, you can see that the model has
two convolution-pooling layers (commonly used in image processing), a
fully connected relu layer and a final softmax output layer (I
separated them by blank lines to help).  Wouldn't it be nice to say
just *that*:

.. testcode::

    @knet function lenet2(x)
        a = conv_pool_layer(x)
        b = conv_pool_layer(a)
        c = relu_layer(b)
        return softmax_layer(c)
    end

.. testoutput:: :hide:

   ...

``lenet2`` is a lot more readable than ``lenet1``.  But before we can
use this definition, we have to solve two problems:

* ``conv_pool_layer`` etc. are not primitive operators, we need a way to add them to Knet.
* Each layer has some attributes, like ``init`` and ``dims``, that we need to be able to configure.

Knet solves the first problem by allowing @knet functions to be used
as operators as well as models.  For example, we can define
``conv_pool_layer`` as an operator with:

.. testcode::

    @knet function conv_pool_layer(x)
        w = par(init=Xavier(), dims=(5,5,1,20))
        c = conv(w,x)
        b = par(init=Constant(0), dims=(1,1,20,1))
        a = add(b,c)
        r = relu(a)
        return pool(r; window=2)
    end

.. testoutput:: :hide:

   ...

With this definition, the the first ``a = conv_pool_layer(x)``
operation in ``lenet2`` will work exactly as we want, but not the
second (it has different convolution dimensions).

This brings us to the second problem, layer configuration.  It would
be nice not to hard-code numbers like ``(5,5,1,20)`` in the definition
of a new operation like ``conv_pool_layer``.  Making these numbers
configurable would make such operations more reusable across models.
Even within the same model, you may want to use the same layer type in
more than one configuration.  For example in ``lenet2`` there is no
way to distinguish the two ``conv_pool_layer`` operations, but looking
at ``lenet1`` we clearly want them to do different things.

.. _keyword arguments: http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.4/manual/functions/#keyword-arguments
.. _three dots: http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.4/manual/faq/?highlight=splat#what-does-the-operator-do

Knet solves the layer configuration problem using `keyword
arguments`_.  Knet functions borrow the keyword argument syntax from
Julia, and we will be using them in many contexts, so a brief aside is
in order: Keyword arguments are identified by name instead of
position, and they can be passed in any order (or not passed at all)
following regular (positional) arguments.  In fact we have already
seen examples: ``dims`` and ``init`` are keyword arguments for ``par``
(which has no regular arguments) and ``window`` is a keyword argument
for ``pool``.  Functions with keyword arguments are defined using a
semicolon in the signature, e.g. ``function pool(x; window=2,
padding=0)``.  The semicolon is optional when the function is called,
e.g. both ``pool(x, window=5)`` or ``pool(x; window=5)`` work.
Unspecified keyword arguments take their default values specified in
the function definition.  Extra keyword arguments can be collected
using `three dots`_ in the function definition: ``function pool(x;
window=2, padding=0, o...)``, and passed in function calls: ``pool(x;
o...)``.

Here is a configurable version of ``conv_pool_layer`` using keyword
arguments:

.. testcode::

    @knet function conv_pool_layer(x; cwindow=0, cinput=0, coutput=0, pwindow=0)
        w = par(init=Xavier(), dims=(cwindow,cwindow,cinput,coutput))
        c = conv(w,x)
        b = par(init=Constant(0), dims=(1,1,coutput,1))
        a = add(b,c)
        r = relu(a)
        return pool(r; window=pwindow)
    end

.. testoutput:: :hide:

   ...

Similarly, we can define ``relu_layer`` and ``softmax_layer`` with
keyword arguments and make them more reusable.  If you did this,
however, you'd notice that we are repeating a lot of code. That is
almost always a bad idea.  Why don't we define a ``generic_layer``
that contains the shared code for all our layers:

.. testcode::

    @knet function generic_layer(x; f1=:dot, f2=:relu, wdims=(), bdims=(), winit=Xavier(), binit=Constant(0))
        w = par(init=winit, dims=wdims)
        y = f1(w,x)
        b = par(init=binit, dims=bdims)
        z = add(b,y)
        return f2(z)
    end

.. testoutput:: :hide:

   ...

Note that in this example we are not only making initialization
parameters like ``winit`` and ``binit`` configurable, we are also
making internal operators like ``relu`` and ``dot`` configurable
(their names need to be escaped with colons when passed as keyword
arguments).  This generic layer will allow us to define many layer
types easily:

.. testcode::

    @knet function conv_pool_layer(x; cwindow=0, cinput=0, coutput=0, pwindow=0)
        y = generic_layer(x; f1=:conv, f2=:relu, wdims=(cwindow,cwindow,cinput,coutput), bdims=(1,1,coutput,1))
        return pool(y; window=pwindow)
    end

    @knet function relu_layer(x; input=0, output=0)
        return generic_layer(x; f1=:dot, f2=:relu, wdims=(output,input), bdims=(output,1))
    end

    @knet function softmax_layer(x; input=0, output=0)
        return generic_layer(x; f1=:dot, f2=:soft, wdims=(output,input), bdims=(output,1))
    end

.. testoutput:: :hide:

   ...

Finally we can define a working version of LeNet using 4 lines of code:

.. testcode::

    @knet function lenet3(x)
        a = conv_pool_layer(x; cwindow=5, cinput=1,  coutput=20, pwindow=2)
        b = conv_pool_layer(a; cwindow=5, cinput=20, coutput=50, pwindow=2)
        c = relu_layer(b; input=800, output=500)
        return softmax_layer(c; input=500, output=10)
    end

.. testoutput:: :hide:

   ...

There are still a lot of hard-coded dimensions in ``lenet3``.  Some of
these, like the filter size (5), and the hidden layer size (500) can
be considered part of the model design.  We should make them
configurable so the user can experiment with different sized models.
But some, like the number of input channels (1), and the input to the
``relu_layer`` (800) are determined by input size.  If we tried to
apply ``lenet3`` to a dataset with different sized images, it would
break.  Knet solves this problem using **size inference**: Any
dimension that relies on the input size can be left as 0, which tells
Knet to infer that dimension when the first input is received.
Leaving input dependent dimensions as 0, and using keyword arguments
to determine model size we arrive at a fully configurable version of
LeNet:

.. testcode::

    @knet function lenet4(x; cwin1=5, cout1=20, pwin1=2, cwin2=5, cout2=50, pwin2=2, hidden=500, nclass=10)
        a = conv_pool_layer(x; cwindow=cwin1, coutput=cout1, pwindow=pwin1)
        b = conv_pool_layer(a; cwindow=cwin2, coutput=cout2, pwindow=pwin2)
        c = relu_layer(b; output=hidden)
        return softmax_layer(c; output=nclass)
    end

.. testoutput:: :hide:

   ...

To compile an instance of ``lenet4`` with particular dimensions, we
pass keyword arguments to ``compile``:

.. doctest::

   julia> f = compile(:lenet4; cout1=30, cout2=60, hidden=600)
   ...

.. _kfun.jl: https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl/blob/master/src/kfun.jl

In this section we saw how to use @knet functions as new operators,
and configure them using keyword arguments.  Using the power of
abstraction, not only did we cut the amount of code for the LeNet
model in half, we made its definition a lot more readable and
configurable, and gained a bunch of reusable operators to boot.  I am
sure you can think of more clever ways to define LeNet and other
complex models using your own set of operators.  To see some example
reusable operators take a look at the :ref:`Knet compound operators
<compounds-table>` table and see their definitions in `kfun.jl`_.

Training with minibatches
-------------------------
.. minibatch, softloss, zeroone

We will use the LeNet model to classify hand-written digits from the
MNIST_ dataset.  Here are the first 8 images from MNIST, the goal is
to look at the pixels and classify each image as one of the digits
0-9:

.. image:: images/firsteightimages.jpg

The following loads the MNIST data:

.. _LeNet: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf
.. _MNIST: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist

.. doctest::

    julia> include(Pkg.dir("Knet/examples/mnist.jl"))
    INFO: Loading MNIST...

Once loaded, the data is available as multi-dimensional Julia arrays:

.. doctest::

    julia> MNIST.xtrn
    28x28x1x60000 Array{Float32,4}:...
    julia> MNIST.ytrn
    10x60000 Array{Float32,2}:...
    julia> MNIST.xtst
    28x28x1x10000 Array{Float32,4}:...
    julia> MNIST.ytst
    10x10000 Array{Float32,2}:...

We have 60000 training and 10000 testing examples.  Each input x is a
28x28x1 array, where the first two numbers represent the width and
height in pixels, the third number is the number of channels (which is
1 for grayscale images, 3 for RGB images etc.)  The pixel values have
been normalized to :math:`[0,1]`.  Each output y is a ten-dimensional
one-hot vector (a vector that has a single non-zero component)
indicating the correct class (0-9) for a given image.

This is a much larger dataset than Housing.  For computational
efficiency, it is not advisable to use these examples one at a time
during training like we did before.  We will split the data into
groups of 100 examples called **minibatches**, and pass data to
``forw`` and ``back`` one minibatch at a time instead of one instance
at a time.  On a machine with a Nvidia K20 GPU, one epoch of training
LeNet on MNIST takes about 3.1 seconds with a minibatch size of 100,
10.8 seconds with a minibatch size of 10, and 75.2 seconds if we do
not use minibatches.  

Knet provides a small ``minibatch`` function to split the data:

.. testcode::

    function minibatch(x, y, batchsize)
        data = Any[]
        for i=1:batchsize:ccount(x)
            j=min(i+batchsize-1,ccount(x))
            push!(data, (cget(x,i:j), cget(y,i:j)))
        end
        return data
    end

.. testoutput:: :hide:

    ...

.. _iterables: http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.4/manual/interfaces/#iteration
.. _subarrays: http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.4/manual/arrays/

``minibatch`` takes ``batchsize`` columns of ``x`` and ``y`` at a
time, pairs them up and pushes them into a ``data`` array.  It works
for arrays of any dimensionality, treating the last dimension as
"columns".  This type of minibatching is fine for small datasets, but
it requires holding two copies of the data in memory.  For problems
with a large amount of data you may want to use subarrays_ or
iterables_.

Here is ``minibatch`` in action:

.. doctest::

    julia> batchsize=100;
    julia> trn = minibatch(MNIST.xtrn, MNIST.ytrn, batchsize)
    600-element Array{Any,1}:...
    julia> tst = minibatch(MNIST.xtst, MNIST.ytst, batchsize)
    100-element Array{Any,1}:...

Each element of ``trn`` and ``tst`` is an x, y pair that contains 100
examples::

    julia> trn[1]
    (28x28x1x100 Array{Float32,4}:
     ...,
     10x100 Array{Float32,2}:
     ...)

Here are some simple train and test functions that use this type of
minibatched data.  Note that they take the loss function as a third
argument:

.. testcode::

    function train(f, data, loss)
        for (x,y) in data
            forw(f, x)
            back(f, y, loss)
            update!(f)
        end
    end

    function test(f, data, loss)
        sumloss = numloss = 0
        for (x,ygold) in data
            ypred = forw(f, x)
            sumloss += loss(ypred, ygold)
            numloss += 1
        end
        sumloss / numloss
    end

.. testoutput::
   :hide:
      
   ...

Before training, we compile the model and set the learning rate to
0.1, which works well for this example.  We use two new :ref:`loss
functions <loss-table>`: ``softloss`` computes the cross entropy loss,
:math:`E(p\log\hat{p})`, commonly used for training classification
models and ``zeroone`` computes the zero-one loss which is the ratio
of predictions that were wrong.  I got 2.26% test error after one
epoch of training.  Your results may be slightly different on
different machines, or different runs on the same machine because of
non-determinism introduced by parallel GPU operations.

.. After one epoch of training I got 2.26% test error.  Your results may
.. be slightly different because some of the convolution operations are
.. non-deterministic.  You should be able to get the error down to 0.8%
.. in about 30 epochs of training.  You can compare this with some
.. benchmark results on the MNIST_ web page:

.. doctest::

   julia> net = compile(:lenet4);
   julia> setp(net; lr=0.1);
   julia> train(net, trn, softloss);
   julia> test(net, tst, zeroone)
   0.0226

In this section we saw how splitting the training data into
minibatches can speed up training.  We trained our first neural
network on a classification problem and used two new loss functions:
``softloss`` and ``zeroone``.

Conditional Evaluation
----------------------

..
   if-else, runtime conditions (kwargs for forw), dropout
   lenet with dropout?  fast enough for cpu?
   lenet is not a good example for dropout does not converge very fast.  dropout may not be
   a good motivator for conditionals: there are other ways to
   implement dropout?, s2c, s2s models may be better?
   lenet with drop=0.4 drop1=0.0 adaptive lr with decay=0.9 gets 0.5%
   (min .0045) in 100 epochs.  with fixed lr=0.1 gets <0.5% in 50
   epochs so no need for the adaptive lr. hmm trying to replicate, 50
   is not enough.
   this should probably come after rnns and sequences.
   could make this a dropout section and have a different conditional
   section. as a dropout section it doesn't need to be in the
   tutorial.  if this is going to be its own section, put more about
   the theory, the alternatives, other types of noise introduction
   papers.

There are cases where you want to execute parts of a model
*conditionally*, e.g. only during training, or only during some parts
of the input in sequence models.  Knet supports the use of **runtime
conditions** for this purpose.  We will illustrate the use of
conditions by implementing a training technique called dropout_ to
improve the generalization power of the LeNet model.

.. _dropout: http://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html
.. _conditional evaluation: http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.4/manual/control-flow/#man-conditional-evaluation

If you keep training the LeNet model on MNIST for about 30 epochs you
will observe that the training error drops to zero but the test error
hovers around 0.8%::

    for epoch=1:100
        train(net, trn, softloss)
        println((epoch, test(net, trn, zeroone), test(net, tst, zeroone)))
    end

    (1,0.020466666666666505,0.024799999999999996)
    (2,0.013649999999999905,0.01820000000000001)
    ...
    (29,0.0,0.008100000000000003)
    (30,0.0,0.008000000000000004)

This is called *overfitting*.  The model has memorized the training
set, but does not generalize equally well to the test set.

Dropout prevents overfitting by injecting random noise into the model.
Specifically, for each ``forw`` call during training, dropout layers
placed between two operations replace a random portion of their input
with zeros, and scale the rest to keep the total output the same.
During testing random noise would degrade performance, so we would
like to turn dropout off.  Here is one way to implement this in Knet::

    @knet function drop(x; pdrop=0, o...)
        if dropout
            return x .* rnd(init=Bernoulli(1-pdrop, 1/(1-pdrop)))
        else
            return x
        end
    end

The keyword argument ``pdrop`` specifies the probability of dropping an
input element.  The ``if ... else ... end`` block causes `conditional
evaluation`_ the way one would expect.  The variable ``dropout`` next to
``if`` is a global condition variable: it is not declared as an argument
to the function.  Instead, once a model with a ``drop`` operation is
compiled, the call to ``forw`` accepts ``dropout`` as an optional keyword
argument and passes it down as a global condition::

    forw(model, input; dropout=true)

This means every time we call ``forw``, we can change whether dropout
occurs or not.  During test time, we would like to stop dropout, so we
can run the model with ``dropout=false``::

    forw(model, input; dropout=false)

By default, all unspecified condition variables are false, so we could
also omit the condition during test time::

    forw(model, input)	# dropout=false is assumed

Here is one way to add dropout to the LeNet model:

.. testcode::

    @knet function lenet5(x; pdrop=0.5, cwin1=5, cout1=20, pwin1=2, cwin2=5, cout2=50, pwin2=2, hidden=500, nclass=10)
        a = conv_pool_layer(x; cwindow=cwin1, coutput=cout1, pwindow=pwin1)
        b = conv_pool_layer(a; cwindow=cwin2, coutput=cout2, pwindow=pwin2)
        bdrop = drop(b; pdrop=pdrop)
        c = relu_layer(bdrop; output=hidden)
        return softmax_layer(c; output=nclass)
    end

.. testoutput:: :hide:

    ...

Whenever the condition variable ``dropout`` is true, this will replace
half of the entries in the ``b`` array with zeros.  We need to modify
our ``train`` function to pass the condition to ``forw``:

.. testcode::

    function train(f, data, loss)
        for (x,y) in data
            forw(f, x; dropout=true)
            back(f, y, loss)
            update!(f)
        end
    end

.. testoutput:: :hide:

    ...

Here is our training script.  Note that we reduce the learning rate
whenever the test error gets worse, another precaution against
overfitting::

    lrate = 0.1
    decay = 0.9
    lasterr = 1.0
    net = compile(:lenet5)
    setp(net; lr=lrate)

    for epoch=1:100
        train(net, trn, softloss)
        trnerr = test(net, trn, zeroone)
        tsterr = test(net, tst, zeroone)
        println((epoch, lrate, trnerr, tsterr))
        if tsterr > lasterr
            lrate = decay*lrate
            setp(net; lr=lrate)
        end
        lasterr = tsterr
    end

In 100 epochs, this should converge to about 0.5% error, i.e. reduce
the total number of errors on the 10K test set from around 80 to
around 50.  Congratulations!  This is fairly close to the state of the
art compared to other benchmark results on the MNIST_ website::

    (1,0.1,0.020749999999999824,0.01960000000000001)
    (2,0.1,0.013699999999999895,0.01600000000000001)
    ...
    (99,0.0014780882941434613,0.0003333333333333334,0.005200000000000002)

In this section, we saw how to use the ``if ... else ... end``
construct to perform conditional evaluation in a model, where the
conditions are passed using keyword arguments to ``forw``.  We used
this to implement ``dropout``, an effective technique to prevent
overfitting.


Recurrent neural networks
-------------------------
.. read-before-write, simple rnn, lstm

.. _Karpathy, 2015: http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/

In this section we will see how to implement **recurrent neural
networks** (RNNs) in Knet.  A RNN is a class of neural network where
connections between units form a directed cycle, which allows them to
keep a persistent state (memory) over time.  This gives them the
ability to process sequences of arbitrary length one element at a
time, while keeping track of what happened at previous elements.
Contrast this with feed forward nets like LeNet, which have a fixed
sized input, output and perform a fixed number of operations. See
(`Karpathy, 2015`_) for a nice introduction to RNNs.

.. _static variables: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_variable

To support RNNs, all local variables in Knet functions are `static
variables`_, i.e. their values are preserved between calls unless
otherwise specified.  It turns out this is the only language feature
you need to define RNNs.  Here is a simple example::

    @knet function rnn1(x; hsize=100, xsize=50)
        a = par(init=Xavier(), dims=(hsize, xsize))
        b = par(init=Xavier(), dims=(hsize, hsize))
        c = par(init=Constant(0), dims=(hsize, 1))
        d = a * x .+ b * h .+ c
        h = relu(d)
    end

Notice anything strange?  The first three lines define three model
parameters.  Then the fourth line sets ``d`` to a linear combination
of the input ``x`` and the hidden state ``h``.  But ``h`` hasn't been
defined yet.  Exactly!  Having read-before-write variables is the only
thing that distinguishes an RNN from feed-forward models like LeNet.

The way Knet handles read-before-write variables is by initializing
them to 0 arrays before any input is processed, then preserving the
values between the calls.  Thus during the first call in the above
example, ``h`` would start as 0, ``d`` would be set to ``a * x .+ c``,
which in turn would cause ``h`` to get set to ``relu(a * x .+ c)``.
During the second call, this value of ``h`` would be remembered and
used, thus making the value of ``h`` at time t dependent on
its value at time t-1.

.. _better initialization: http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00941
.. _smarter updates: http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06464
.. _LSTMs: http://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/pdfs/Hochreiter97_lstm.pdf
.. _GRUs: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1078v3
.. _Colah, 2015: http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs

It turns out simple RNNs like ``rnn1`` are not very good at
remembering things for a very long time.  There are some techniques to
improve their retention based on `better initialization`_ or `smarter
updates`_, but currently the most popular solution is using more
complicated units like LSTMs_ and GRUs_.  These units control the
information flow into and out of the unit using gates similar to
digital circuits and can model long term dependencies.  See (`Colah,
2015`_) for a good overview of LSTMs.

Defining an LSTM in Knet is almost as concise as writing its
mathematical definition:

.. testcode::

    @knet function lstm(x; fbias=1, o...)
        input  = wbf2(x,h; o..., f=:sigm)
        forget = wbf2(x,h; o..., f=:sigm, binit=Constant(fbias))
        output = wbf2(x,h; o..., f=:sigm)
        newmem = wbf2(x,h; o..., f=:tanh)
        cell = input .* newmem + cell .* forget
        h  = tanh(cell) .* output
        return h
    end

.. testoutput:: :hide:

    ...

The ``wbf2`` operator applies an affine function (linear function +
bias) to its two inputs followed by an activation function (specified
by the ``f`` keyword argument).  Try to define this operator yourself
as an exercise, (see kfun.jl_ for the Knet definition).  

The LSTM has an input gate, forget gate and an output gate that
control information flow.  Each gate depends on the current input
``x``, and the last output ``h``.  The memory value ``cell`` is
computed by blending a new value ``newmem`` with its old value under
the control of ``input`` and ``forget`` gates.  The ``output`` gate
decides how much of the ``cell`` is shared with the outside world.

If an ``input`` gate element is close to 0, the corresponding element
in the new input ``x`` will have little effect on the memory cell.  If
a ``forget`` gate element is close to 1, the contents of the
corresponding memory cell can be preserved for a long time.  Thus the
LSTM has the ability to pay attention to the current input, or
reminisce in the past, and it can learn when to do which based on the
problem.

In this section we introduced simple recurrent neural networks and
LSTMs.  We saw that having static variables is the only language
feature necessary to implement RNNs.  Next we will look at how to
train them.

Training with sequences
-----------------------

(`Karpathy, 2015`_) has lots of fun examples showing how character
based language models based on LSTMs are surprisingly adept at
generating text in many genres, from Wikipedia articles to C programs.
To demonstrate training with sequences, we'll implement one of these
examples and build a model that can write like Shakespeare!  After
training on "The Complete Works of William Shakespeare" for less than
an hour, here is a sample of brilliant writing you can expect from
your model::

  LUCETTA. Welcome, getzing a knot. There is as I thought you aim
    Cack to Corioli.
  MACBETH. So it were timen'd nobility and prayers after God'.
  FIRST SOLDIER. O, that, a tailor, cold.
  DIANA. Good Master Anne Warwick!
  SECOND WARD. Hold, almost proverb as one worth ne'er;
    And do I above thee confer to look his dead;
    I'll know that you are ood'd with memines;
    The name of Cupid wiltwite tears will hold
    As so I fled; and purgut not brightens,
    Their forves and speed as with these terms of Ely
    Whose picture is not dignitories of which,
    Their than disgrace to him she is.
  GOBARIND. O Sure, ThisH more.,
    wherein hath he been not their deed of quantity,
    No ere we spoke itation on the tent.
    I will be a thought of base-thief;
    Then tears you ever steal to have you kindness.
    And so, doth not make best in lady,
    Your love was execreed'd fray where Thoman's nature;
    I have bad Tlauphie he should sray and gentle,


.. _Project Gutenberg: https://www.gutenberg.org

First let's download "The Complete Works of William Shakespeare" from
`Project Gutenberg`_:

.. doctest::

   julia> using Requests
   julia> url="http://gutenberg.pglaf.org/1/0/100/100.txt";
   julia> text=get(url).data
   5589917-element Array{UInt8,1}:...

The ``text`` array now has all 5,589,917 characters of "The Complete
Works" in a Julia array.  If ``get`` does not work, you can download
``100.txt`` by other means and use ``text=readall("100.txt")`` on the
local file.  We will use one-hot vectors to represent characters, so
let's map each character to an integer index :math:`1\ldots n`:

.. doctest::

   julia> char2int = Dict();
   julia> for c in text; get!(char2int, c, 1+length(char2int)); end
   julia> nchar = length(char2int)
   92

.. _associative collection: http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.4/stdlib/collections/#associative-collections

``Dict`` is Julia's standard `associative collection`_ for mapping
arbitrary keys to values.  ``get!(dict,key,default)`` returns the
value for the given key, storing ``key=>default`` in ``dict`` if no
mapping for the key is present.  Going over the ``text`` array we
discover 92 unique characters and map them to integers :math:`1\ldots
92`.

We will train our RNN to read characters from ``text`` in sequence,
and predict the next character after each.  The training will go much
faster if we can use the minibatching trick we saw earlier and process
multiple inputs at a time.  For that, we split the text array into
``batchsize`` equal length subsequences.  Then the first batch has the
first character from each subsequence, second batch contains the
second characters etc.  Each minibatch is represented by a ``nchar x
batchsize`` matrix with one-hot columns.  Here is a function that
implements this type of sequence minibatching:

.. testcode::

   function seqbatch(seq, dict, batchsize)
       data = Any[]
       T = div(length(seq), batchsize)
       for t=1:T
	   d=zeros(Float32, length(dict), batchsize)
	   for b=1:batchsize
	       c = dict[seq[t + (b-1) * T]]
	       d[c,b] = 1
	   end
	   push!(data, d)
       end
       return data
   end

.. testoutput:: :hide:

   ...

Let's use it to split ``text`` into minibatches of size 128:

.. doctest::

   julia> batchsize = 128;
   julia> data = seqbatch(text, char2int, batchsize)
   43671-element Array{Any,1}:...
   julia> data[1]
   92x128 Array{Float32,2}:...

The data array returned has ``T=length(text)/batchsize`` minibatches.
The columns of minibatch ``data[t]`` refer to characters ``t``,
``t+T``, ``t+2T``, ... from ``text``.  During training, when
``data[t]`` is the input, ``data[t+1]`` will be the desired output.
Now that we have the data ready to go, let's talk about RNN training.

RNN training is a bit more involved than training feed-forward models.
We still have the prediction, gradient calculation and update steps,
but not all three steps should be performed after every input.  Here
is a basic algorithm: Go forward ``nforw`` steps, remembering the
desired outputs and model state, then perform ``nforw`` back steps
accumulating gradients, finally update the parameters and reset the
network for the next iteration:

.. testcode::

   function train(f, data, loss; nforw=100, gclip=0)
       reset!(f)
       ystack = Any[]
       T = length(data) - 1
       for t = 1:T
	   x = data[t]
	   y = data[t+1]
	   sforw(f, x; dropout=true)
	   push!(ystack, y)
	   if (t % nforw == 0 || t == T)
	       while !isempty(ystack)
		   ygold = pop!(ystack)
		   sback(f, ygold, loss)
	       end
	       update!(f; gclip=gclip)
	       reset!(f; keepstate=true)
	   end
       end
   end

.. testoutput:: :hide:

   ...

Note that we use ``sforw`` and ``sback`` instead of ``forw`` and
``back`` during sequence training: these save and restore internal
state to allow multiple forward steps followed by multiple backward
steps.  ``reset!`` is necessary to zero out or recover internal state
before a sequence of forward steps.  ``ystack`` is used to store gold
answers.  The ``gclip`` is for gradient clipping, a common RNN
training strategy to keep the parameters from diverging.

With data and training script ready, all we need is a model.  We will
define a character based RNN language model using an LSTM:

.. testcode::

   @knet function charlm(x; embedding=0, hidden=0, pdrop=0, nchar=0)
       a = wdot(x; out=embedding)
       b = lstm(a; out=hidden)
       c = drop(b; pdrop=pdrop)
       return wbf(c; out=nchar, f=:soft)
   end

.. testoutput:: :hide:

   ...

``wdot`` multiplies the one-hot representation ``x`` of the input
character with an embedding matrix and turns it into a dense vector of
size ``embedding``.  We apply an LSTM of size ``hidden`` to this dense
vector, and dropout the result with probability ``pdrop``.  Finally
``wbf`` applies softmax to a linear function of the LSTM output to get
a probability vector of size ``nchar`` for the next character.

(`Karpathy, 2015`_) uses not one but several LSTM layers to simulate
Shakespeare.  In Knet, we can define a multi-layer LSTM model using
the high-level operator ``repeat``:

.. testcode::

   @knet function lstmdrop(a; pdrop=0, hidden=0)
       b = lstm(a; out=hidden)
       return drop(b; pdrop=pdrop)
   end

   @knet function charlm2(x; nlayer=0, embedding=0, hidden=0, pdrop=0, nchar=0)
       a = wdot(x; out=embedding)
       c = repeat(a; frepeat=:lstmdrop, nrepeat=nlayer, hidden=hidden, pdrop=pdrop)
       return wbf(c; out=nchar, f=:soft)
   end

.. testoutput:: :hide:

   ...

In ``charlm2``, the ``repeat`` instruction will perform the
``frepeat`` operation ``nrepeat`` times starting with input ``a``.
Using ``charlm2`` with ``nlayer=1`` would be equivalent to the
original ``charlm``.

In the interest of time we will start with a small single layer model.
With the following parameters, 10 epochs of training takes about 35-40
minutes on a K20 GPU:

.. doctest::

   julia> net = compile(:charlm; embedding=256, hidden=512, pdrop=0.2, nchar=nchar);
   julia> setp(net; lr=1.0)
   julia> for i=1:10; train(net, data, softloss; gclip=5.0); end

.. _JLD: https://github.com/JuliaLang/JLD.jl

After spending this much time training a model, you probably want to
save it.  Knet uses the JLD_ module to save and load models and data.
Calling ``clean(model)`` during a save is recommended to strip the
model of temporary arrays which may save a lot of space.  Don't forget
to save the ``char2int`` dictionary, otherwise it will be difficult to
interpret the output of the model:

.. doctest::

   julia> using JLD
   julia> JLD.save("charlm.jld", "model", clean(net), "dict", char2int);
   julia> net2 = JLD.load("charlm.jld", "model")	# should create a copy of net
   ...

TODO: put load/save and other fns in the function table.

Finally, to generate the Shakespearean output we promised, we need to
implement a generator.  The following generator samples a character
from the probability vector output by the model, prints it and feeds
it back to the model to get the next character.  Note that we use
regular ``forw`` in ``generate``, ``sforw`` is only necessary when
training RNNs.

.. testcode::

   function generate(f, int2char, nchar)
       reset!(f)
       x=zeros(Float32, length(int2char), 1)
       y=zeros(Float32, length(int2char), 1)
       xi = 1
       for i=1:nchar
	   copy!(y, forw(f,x))
	   x[xi] = 0
	   xi = sample(y)
	   x[xi] = 1
	   print(int2char[xi])
       end
       println()
   end

   function sample(pdist)
       r = rand(Float32)
       p = 0
       for c=1:length(pdist)
	   p += pdist[c]
	   r <= p && return c
       end
   end

.. testoutput:: :hide:

   ...

.. doctest::

   julia> int2char = Array(Char, length(char2int));
   julia> for (c,i) in char2int; int2char[i] = Char(c); end
   julia> generate(net, int2char, 1024)  # should generate 1024 chars of Shakespeare

**Table 5: Training options**

We can manipulate how exactly ``update!`` behaves by setting some
training options like the learning rate ``lr``.  I'll explain the
mathematical motivation elsewhere, but algorithmically these training
options manipulate the ``dw`` array (sometimes using an auxiliary
array ``dw2``) before the subtraction to improve the loss faster.
Here is a list of training options supported by Knet and how they
manipulate ``dw``:

=============================== ==============================================================================
Option	                	Description
=============================== ==============================================================================
``lr``				Learning rate: ``dw *= lr``
``l1reg``			L1 regularization: ``dw += l1reg * sign(w)``
``l2reg``			L2 regularization: ``dw += l2reg * w``

``rmsprop``			Rmsprop (boolean): ``dw2 = dw2 * 0.9 + 0.1 * dw .* dw; dw = dw ./ (1e-8 + sqrt(dw2))``

.. This looks a lot like a regular `Julia function definition`_ except
.. for the ``@knet`` macro.  However it is important to emphasize that
.. the ``@knet`` macro does not define ``lin`` as a regular Julia
.. function or variable.  Furthermore, only a restricted set of statement
.. types (e.g. assignment and return statements) and operators
.. (e.g. ``par``, ``*`` and ``.+``) can be used in a @knet function
.. definition.  A list of Knet primitive operators is given below:

.. .. Note that we need to escape Knet variable names using the `colon
.. .. character`_ just like we did for ``:lin`` when compiling.

.. ..
..    This defines ``f`` as an actual model (model or Net?) that we can
..    train and use for predictions (repeated).  Note that the colon
..    character preceding the name of our Knet function is required in the
..    compile expression.  (TODO: can we get rid of the colon with a macro?)
..    (TODO: The motivation behind this two step process, first defining a
..    Knet function then compiling it into a model, will become more clear
..    when we introduce compile time parameters.)

.. ..
..    Also note that ``lin`` is not defined as a regular Julia function or
..    variable.

.. ..
..    So far it looks like all Knet gave us is a very complicated way to
..    define a very simple function.  So why would anybody bother defining a
..    @knet function with all the syntactic restrictions, limited number of
..    operators, need for compilation etc.?

.. There are many ways to reduce overfitting: more training data, a
.. smaller model with fewer parameters, regularization , and early
.. stopping can all help, and will be covered later (remember the
.. ``l1reg`` and ``l2reg`` from the :ref:`table of training options
.. <training-options-table>`).  For now let's focus on dropout.

..
   TODO: remove the ! from update! ?
   TODO: have an objective function instead of a loss function?

.. Using these, we can write a simple training script:

.. We can set these training options for individual parameters using
.. e.g. ``setp(f, :w; lr=0.001)``, or for the whole model using ``setp(f;
.. lr=0.001)``.  

.. .. [#] `Broadcasting operations`_ are element-by-element binary
..        operations on arrays of possibly different sizes, such as
..        adding a vector to each column of a matrix.  They expand
..        singleton dimensions in array arguments to match the
..        corresponding dimension in the other array without using extra
..        memory, and apply the given function elementwise.
